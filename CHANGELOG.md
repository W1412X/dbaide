# Changelog

All notable changes to DBAide are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Config file corruption on save→reload→save cycle** — `_render_toml` placed
  `default_connection` and `default_model` after the `[meta]` table header, so
  TOML scoping absorbed them into `meta` on reload. A subsequent save wrote them
  twice under `[meta]`, producing `Cannot overwrite a value` on the next load.
  Root-level keys now render before any `[table]` header. The reload path also
  recovers keys that were previously absorbed into `meta`.
- **Config wipe on parse failure** — when `config.toml` had a TOML syntax error,
  `reload()` fell back to an empty config, migrated it, and saved — overwriting
  the user's (possibly recoverable) file with empty data. The save is now skipped
  when parsing fails.
- **Connection names with dots produce invalid TOML** — a connection named
  `my.server` generated `[connections.my.server]` (nested tables) instead of
  `[connections."my.server"]`. Names are now quoted when they contain dots, spaces,
  or other TOML-special characters.
- **Streaming text loss on RuntimeError recovery** — when the answer widget was
  destroyed mid-stream (PyQt RuntimeError), recreating it reset the accumulated
  text, losing all chunks received so far. The unnecessary reset is removed;
  `begin_turn()` handles the normal-path reset.
- **Schema guard dead code** — an unreachable duplicate CTE check and a redundant
  condition were removed from `validate_table_refs`, simplifying the logic.
- **LLM non-streaming JSON decode crash** — `json.JSONDecodeError` (a `ValueError`
  subclass) escaped the retry loop, crashing the run on malformed model responses.
  `ValueError` is now caught alongside `URLError`/`TimeoutError`/`OSError`.
- **Float conversion crash on non-numeric confidence** — `float("high")` in
  `sql_writer` and `schema_context` raised `ValueError`. Both sites now guard
  with try-except.
- **Stale widget references after session switch** — `_live_answer`,
  `_live_answer_text`, and `_clarification_bar` were not reset in `clear()`,
  leaving dangling references to deleted widgets.
- **Composer attach button enabled during execution** — the "+" context button
  remained clickable while a query was running. It is now disabled alongside the
  input and model selector.
- **Port field crash on malformed config** — `int(port)` in `ConnectionForm.load()`
  could crash the settings dialog on non-numeric port values. Guarded with
  try-except.
- **Join editor missing required-field validation** — `_edit()` in the joins tab
  lacked the same required-field check that `_add()` had. Both now validate that
  all four endpoint fields are populated.

## [0.0.6] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Batched tool calls** — one decision may now carry several independent read-only
  evidence calls (e.g. describe two tables + profile a column) and the loop runs
  them in order, decides once from all results. Significantly cuts the number of
  LLM round-trips on data questions. The generate→validate→execute SQL chain,
  ask_user, and writes stay one-per-decision so each keeps its safety gate.

### Changed

- **New app icon** — three concentric arcs in a polished-graphite gradient on a
  transparent canvas. Single mark, restrained, reads well on both light and dark
  surfaces. Same SVG drives the macOS `.icns`, the Windows `.ico`, and the in-app
  window/dock icon.
- **UI polish** — header now shows the app mark next to the wordmark; workbench
  tabs no longer clip "Query 1" to "Quer…"; the Connection dialog uses the app's
  accent/ghost buttons instead of a native button box so dialogs read consistently.

### Fixed

- **Trace tree mangled after a clarification** — when an `ask_user` pause was
  followed by the user replying, the resumed steps used the same `decision:N` /
  `step:N` node ids as the pre-pause portion of the same turn. The desktop's
  TraceModel keyed nodes by id, so the resumed steps silently overwrote the
  earlier ones — work disappeared from the tree. Step numbering is now carried
  across the pause so every node id stays unique within a turn.
- **The "Waiting for user clarification" marker sat outside the loop** — it was
  emitted at the trace root with no parent. Now it nests under the `ask_user`
  tool step, so the hierarchy reads *loop → ask_user → Waiting…*.

## [0.0.5] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **App icon** — a minimalist database mark (a blue "data" top on a dark squircle,
  in the app's accent colour) now ships for the macOS app, the Windows installer,
  and the running window / dock / taskbar.
- **Verified-knowledge tier in working memory** — the agent separates conclusions
  it has *verified* with tool evidence (or that you confirmed) from tentative
  observations and guesses, so each decision can rely on what is actually settled
  instead of re-litigating it.
- **Paginated, range-aware tools** — `profile_table` windows columns with
  `column_offset`/`column_limit` and reports `total_columns`; `column_stats`
  exposes `top_k`; `inspect_metadata` reports `total_tables`. No column, table, or
  value is silently skipped — the tool says how many exist and how to fetch the rest.

### Changed

- **Working memory reads did-what → result → judgment** — every step records why it
  ran, a readable one-line result (instead of a raw JSON dump), and the model's
  assessment of the outcome, so the agent keeps a clear, honest account of progress.
- **No silent truncation anywhere the agent looks** — every capped list it sees
  (table columns, candidate tables, distinct values, join relations, SQL result
  rows) now signals "+N more" *and* how to get the rest (retrieve the archived
  result, page with a range parameter, or use SQL `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`).
- **Leaner decision prompt** — de-duplicated the agent's instructions (~3.1k → ~2.5k
  tokens) with no change in behaviour.

### Fixed

- **The agent could miss the column or table a question depended on.** Schema
  evidence silently capped at the first 10 columns / 8 candidate tables, so it could
  query the wrong field (e.g. searching `username` while the name lived in
  `nick_name`) and then spiral. It now sees them, or is explicitly told they exist
  and how to load them.
- **A clarification request could crash the run.** When the model phrased `ask_user`
  as the action rather than a tool call, the loop failed the whole run; it now
  coerces the shape and pauses to ask you, as intended.
- **Row-capped SQL results are flagged** so the agent does not report a truncated
  list as if it were complete.

## [0.0.4] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Streaming answers** — the assistant's final answer now streams in token-by-token
  over SSE as the model writes it, so the first words appear immediately. Only the
  final answer streams; intermediate tool steps don't. Toggle in **Settings → General**
  ("Reveal answers progressively", default on); when off, or when the model can't
  stream, the answer renders once it's ready. No front-end simulation — what you see
  is the real generation.

### Changed

- **Proactive business-caliber clarification** — the agent now applies one clear
  principle: separate what the **data can reveal** (table/column existence, what
  values a column holds, how tables relate — discovered with tools, never asked)
  from what only **your intent can decide**, and it confirms the latter before
  answering whenever the question, the schema, the data, your saved notes, and
  today's date still can't pin down which interpretation you mean — e.g. an
  under-specified time range, what a metric actually counts, how a qualitative
  judgement becomes a concrete rule, or which records are included. It asks one
  consolidated question with concrete options instead of silently picking a
  default and reporting a subtly wrong number; your confirmed answers are applied
  verbatim to the generated SQL. Today's date is now given to the agent so
  genuinely relative periods resolve on their own.

### Fixed

- **Agent no longer aborts on valid multi-line answers** — a finish answer whose
  markdown contained a real newline made strict JSON parsing fail (`Invalid control
  character`) and killed the run at the last step. Parsing now tolerates control
  characters in strings, and a malformed decision is retried instead of crashing.
- **Cancellation during answer streaming** — cancelling mid-stream now stops
  immediately instead of being swallowed into a wasteful non-stream re-request.

### Internal

- Removed a large amount of dead code with no behaviour change: the orphaned
  `eval/` package, unreferenced functions across the agent/adapters/core/history/
  rendering layers, and test-only helpers; tidied stale imports. Refreshed
  `docs/DESIGN.md` to match the code.

## [0.0.3] — 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **macOS desktop app launch** — CI and local builds now ad-hoc sign the `.app`
  bundle (`scripts/codesign_macos.sh`) so PyInstaller packages open on macOS 15+
  without silently exiting. Release workflow includes a macOS startup smoke test
  before publishing the DMG.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-06-05

### Added — Workbench (a read-only database client)

The desktop app gains an **Assistant / Workbench** mode switch. The Workbench is a
DBeaver-style, multi-document workspace, all routed through the same read-only
guardrails as the agent:

- **Multi-document tabs** — multiple SQL editors and per-table viewers open at once,
  closeable and re-orderable, with a pinned Query History tab. Shortcuts: `⌘1`/`⌘2`
  (mode), `⌘T` (new editor), `⌘W` (close).
- **SQL editor** — schema-aware autocomplete, line numbers, current-line highlight,
  **Format**, **Explain** (query plan), comment toggle (`⌘/`), and run the **selection
  or the statement under the cursor** (`⌘↵`).
- **Data browser** — paginated/sortable/filterable grid, row-number gutter, on-demand
  exact **row count**, inline value viewer with JSON pretty-printing, and **foreign-key
  navigation** (right-click a FK cell → open the referenced row).
- **Structure** — columns, foreign-key relations (in/out, clickable), indexes, and a
  generated, copyable `CREATE TABLE`.
- **Query history** — per-connection, click to load, double-click to run.
- **Export** — copy or save results as CSV / JSON / Markdown / `INSERT`.
- **Schema tree** — right-click to open a table or **Generate SQL** templates; copy
  (qualified) names.

### Changed

- Opening a table shows its (offline, instant) **Structure** first; the data query
  runs lazily only when you open the Data tab.
- The Trace / Inspector activity panel is now Assistant-only; the Workbench uses the
  full width.
- Connection forms show only the fields relevant to the selected type.

## [0.1.0] — 2025

First public release: a local-first AI database assistant available as both a CLI
and a PyQt6 desktop app, sharing one Python core.

### Highlights

- **Agentic Ask** — a tool loop discovers schema, maps joins, writes and validates
  read-only SQL, executes it, and interprets the result, streaming every step to a
  Trace panel.
- **Never-guess clarification** — when a question is ambiguous (which table, what a
  status value means, which timezone, what a metric counts), the agent asks you to
  confirm instead of inventing a default.
- **Safe by default** — read-only single statements, per-statement timeout, row caps,
  `EXPLAIN` cost gate, confirmation on risky queries, and a log of every executed SQL.
- **Concurrent sessions** — run multiple conversations at once, capped by a
  configurable limit; switch between them while they work.
- **SQL workspace** — editor with `⌘↵` to run, flat result grid, and "Open in SQL"
  from any agent answer.
- **Progressive schema assets** — offline instance → database → table → column
  documents accelerate discovery; live adapters are the fallback.
- **Databases**: SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL. **Languages**: English, 简体中文
  (answers follow the UI language).
- **Rich Markdown** answers (mistune): tables, code, blockquotes, lists.

### Packaging

- Native installers built and published by CI for **macOS (`.dmg`,
  drag-to-Applications)**, **Windows (`.msi` wizard)**, and **Linux (`.tar.gz`)** —
  pushing a `v*` tag cuts a GitHub Release automatically.
